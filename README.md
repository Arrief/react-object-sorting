# A React app letting the user update the UI with sort options
A test to figure out ways to sort alphabetic and numeric object values and give the user the option to update the list of items displayed in the UI, according to the selected sort option.

## Optional backend
Backend was added just to practice, but is not necessary: the data is present in the frontend directory too, uncommenting and commenting a few lines in FlightsPage.js & MoviesPage.js (specific lines are indicated there) will remove the backend dependency and make the app fully function with the frontend directory only.

#### If you want to run the app with backend:
1. Open your terminal, cd into /backend and run the command: npm start
2. Keep this terminal open at all times and start a second terminal/tab
3. There, cd into /frontend and type again: npm start

#### If you want to run the app without backend:
1. Comment/uncomment the specified lines in FlightsPage.js & MoviesPage.js
2. Open your terminal, cd into /frontend and run the command: npm start
